# UK-Accidents-Analysis

The objective of this task is to analyse, explore and build a simple machine learning module based on the UK accident data set during the
period of 2017. The task deliverable includes Jupyter Notebook which contains the analysis and exploration.

Collected and analysed the road accident data from UK accidents 2017 using Jupyter notebook and build a machine learning model which should
predict whether the police officer likely to attend the case or not. Design a long term approach for large amount this type data processing,
storing, implementation of machine learning model in large production scale.
